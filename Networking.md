### <a name="tools"></a>Tools

**Packet Tracer** can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.netacad.com/group/offerings/packet-tracer). Packet tracer supports Windows, Mac, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu official, others have ports), Android and iOS are also supported. ***You must log in to NetAcademy to download Packet Tracer!***

**Hex to Decimal conversions**

At some point it was decided that this needed to be made. So I made it. [Click here to see the table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J5Y_HneAO0Vp06krJtton1Cmbv5MLPeVQXAt1hPSl8s/edit?usp=sharing). In order to use it, append the number at the top of your column to the front of the hex character to the left side of your current row.
