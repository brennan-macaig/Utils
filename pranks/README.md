## Pranks

These are some prank files that I either wrote or collected.

Some basic file structure:

    win_*.* - Indicates Windows program
    mac_*.* - Indicates Mac OSX program
    lnx_*.* - Indicates Linux program

Combinations of the above obviously are cross-platform. If no OS is indicated it is assumed that they will work on ALL devices.
