# Utils
This is a collection of scripts and utilities I keep for reasons.

Everything should be pretty self-explanatory of what it does, but if I don't think the name of the file is clear then I'll include a .txt with it.

I don't recommend you just blanket-download these scripts - some of them are made for only my computer, and won't work otherplaces. Others are prank files that I made for fun.

Use any of these files at your own risk. Some of them can get pretty delete-y so watch out from that. The .txt files should explain about those when needed.

Have fun with this pile of crap.

**Please note:** I mostly use this for myself to transport files from machines I'm working on.
